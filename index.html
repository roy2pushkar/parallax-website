          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.
          <br />
          Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring,
          skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving,river rafting, or other
          extreme sports.
          <br />
          Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in
          order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that
          can only be obtained by such activities.

          Mountain biking is an adventure sport in which you go cycling across
          the unforgiving roads and alleys in tough mountain terrains.
          <br />
          It is an off-road bicycling that can be pulled off only on specially
          designed bicycles and requires a lot of practice and stamina.
          <br />
          For adventurers, it is a test of their nerve, precision, and optimum
          fitness.

          Do you ever dream of flying -- making lazy circles in the sky like a
          seagull or a hawk? If you do, you're not alone. Dreaming of flying is
          quite common, and if you believe dream analysis, it's a sign of good
          things to come. It means you're on top of a particular situation and
          that you're enjoying a sense
          <br />
          of power and freedom [source: Dream Moods].But you don't have to leave
          flying to your dreams. You can do it while you're awake. We're not
          talking about flying in an airplane or a hot air balloon. We're
          talking about paragliding -- nonmotorized, foot-launched flying with
          an inflatable wing. Enthusiasts
          <br />
          call it the simplest form of human flight. Using air currents and
          shifting their own body weight, paragliders can fly to heights of
          23,000 feet (7,000 meters) with their paragliding sails. You can't
          beat the view, and paragliders find the solitude incredibly peaceful.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores,
          <br />
          but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes,
          in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.The term
          surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of
          the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would
          often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          <br />
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
